# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is my second Milestone project which is basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This game has been designed a time consumer for example for people commuting to work or from work.
The game is endless with a prospect of resetting the game.

Rules of the are quite simple. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock. If user and computer uses same hand e.g rock versus rock game will be tied.

### Possible future features and additions to the website

- In the future, I would like to seperate this game into two modes endless and competitive. Currently game has only endless mode.
- Competitive mode could include Limited losses against computer to see how many wins a user could acomplish before game ends.
- Possible highscores sections where users could leave their Highscores as a part of competition.
- Animate user and computer choice that they pop up on the screen as buttons are pressed.
