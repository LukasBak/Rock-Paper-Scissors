# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is my second Milestone project which is basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This game has been designed a time consumer for example for people commuting to work or from work.
The game is endless with a prospect of resetting the game.

Rules of the are quite simple. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock. If user and computer uses same hand e.g rock versus rock game will be tied.
