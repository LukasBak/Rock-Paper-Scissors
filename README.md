# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is my second Milestone project which is a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This game has been designed as a time consumer for example for people commuting to work or from work. The game is endless with the prospect of resetting the game.

The rules of the game are quite simple. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If the user and computer use the same hand e.g rock versus rock game will be tied.

### Possible future features and additions to the website

- In the future, I would like to separate this game into two modes endless and competitive. Currently the game has only endless mode.
- The competitive mode could include Limited losses against the computer to see how many wins a user could accomplish before the game ends.
- Possible highscores sections where users could leave their Highscores as a part of competition.
- Animate user and computer choice that they pop up on the screen as buttons are pressed.
